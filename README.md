[Pyrana Earthquake Hackathon](https://www.pyrana.org/pyrana-earthquake-hackathon)

This is the 'Automating publicatoin on website' job
of the 'Albanian Seismology Institute Needs' Category
in the Pyrana Earthquake Hackathon

It is a python script that watches the rss feed for
changes using inotify and when changes are detected
it parses the rss feed for the latest earthquake
and pushes it to the database, which publishes it in
the website.

To install just clone the repository wherever Athena
generates the rss feed or change the path in the script
to the path of the rss file.

Thanks to "Lufthansa Industry Solutions", "Techspace" and "EU for innovation"
